I have downloaded 50 bestseller books on Amazon. To explore the context, I have decided to download missing information from Goodreads database to see if there are other factors making these books popular. 

As the first step I have downloaded Amazon Top 50 Bestselling Books 2009 - 2019 and imported the file using pandas. I got 550 rows categorized into fiction and non-fiction. 

# Open .csv file using pandas under book
books = pd.read_csv('/Users/vsturalova/Downloads/bestsellers with categories.csv', parse_dates=['Year'])
Print(books.head())

# Get the number of records and columns
Print(books.shape)

# Check missing values
books.duplicated().sum()

The data has no missing values so no further exploration is required
